    question: 'Which color is best suitable for the bedroom?',
    answer: `The bedroom is the most personal space in your house, and the color combination of your bedroom walls are a direct reflection of your personality. Since wall paint colors come in various shades and chaos is unavoidable while deciding on the numerous shades available, we suggest some of the best two-color combination ideas for your bedroom. Indigo and white is a calm color palette for a bedroom – when paired together, it creates a cozy environment. Brown paired with cream or off-white gives an elegant and sophisticated look to your oasis. If you want a simple hue – gray is a classy option that blends well even with its own shades.`,
